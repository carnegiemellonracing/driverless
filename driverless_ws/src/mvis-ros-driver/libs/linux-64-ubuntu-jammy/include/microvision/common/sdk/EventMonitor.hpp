//! \brief Thread-safe handler for a group of events.
//!
//! This class monitors \e signalling and \e waiting of multiple events.
//! It implements the "Monitor Object" programming pattern.
//!
//! A thread can call wait() to wait for one or more events. This will block
//! the thread (consuming no CPU time anymore) until another thread calls
//! signal() for one of these events. As soon as the other thread calls signal()
//! for that event the blocked thread enters the ready-state and both threads
//! continue running.
//!
//! This class extends boost::condition which is &quot;a synchronization primitive
//! used to cause a thread to wait until a particular shared-data condition
//! (or time) is met&quot; (see documentation of boost::condition). In contrast to
//! boost::condition, this class can wait for multiple events similar to
//! \c WaitForMultipleObjects() of the Windows API.
//!
//! An event is represented by one bit out of an uint32_t. It is selected for
//! \e signalling if the corresponding event bit is \c true. The EventMonitor
//! may contain up to 32 user-defined bits. The events are \e automatic, i.e.
//! the corresponding bits are buffered and keep their states until they are
//! read, which means that one thread waits for this event bit. After that,
//! they are automatically reset to \e not \e signalled.
//!
//! Since events are used for communication between threads, special care must
//! be taken when accessing events. The EventMonitor provides thread-safe read
//! methods (called wait()) and write methods (called signal()) to modify event
//! bits.
//!
//! This class uses Boost threads for synchronization. Code examples for using
//! Boost threads can be found on Linux system in the folder
//! file:///usr/share/doc/libboost-doc/examples/libs/thread/example .
//!
//! The wait() methods in this class behave similar to the function
//! \c WaitForMultipleObjects() known from the Microsoft Windows API.
//! \c WaitForMultipleObjects() is reimplemented here by means of the
//! Boost library based on the ideas from
//! http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/boost/1155002 .

    //! \brief  Data type of an event mask.
    //!

    //! combination of zero or more events. Note that each bit corresponds
    //! to an event.

    //!
    //! \return The new event bit or 0 if there are no more events available.
    //!         The current implementation supports up to 32 events per

    //! \brief Signal event(s).
    //!
    //! All waiting threads will be notified about the signalled event(s).
    //! All active (non-waiting) threads will detect the event(s) upon their
    //! next wait() call.
    //!
    //! \param[in] eventMask Bit mask of the events to signal. To signal more
    //!                  than one event combine the corresponding bits with a
    //!                  logical OR.

    //!                   optional pointer to a function that is
    //!                   called back if any of the bits in \a eventMask is
    //!                   still set, i.e. if an event has not been handled yet.
    //!                   This feature can be used e.g. to detect real-time
    //!                   violations.
    //----------------------------------------
    void signal(const Mask eventMask, void (*onUnhandledEvent)(Mask) = nullptr);

    //========================================
    //! \brief Wait for at least one event.
    //!
    //! If the event has been signalled already since the last wait() call,
    //! thread execution continues immediately. Otherwise, the thread will
    //! wait until one of the specified events is signalled. The event bits
    //! are reset automatically when wait() returns.
    //!
    //! \param[in] eventMask  Bit mask of the expected events. To wait for more
    //!                   than one event combine the corresponding bits using
    //!                   logical OR. value should be non-null.
    //!
    //! \return The bit mask of the events that have waked up the thread.
    //! Multiple events are logically OR'ed in the mask.
    //!
    //! \note Multiple events will be returned if any of the following
    //! conditions is true:
    //! - Multiple events are passed to signal().
    //! - While handling an event, at least two different events are
    //!   signalled by other threads. These new events will be returned
    //!   altogether at the next wait() call (assuming that \a eventMask
    //!   matches).
    //!
    //! \sa wait(const boost::posix_time::time_duration&, Mask)
    //----------------------------------------
    Mask wait(const Mask eventMask);

    //========================================
    //! \brief Wait a limited time for at least one event.
    //!
    //! The same as wait(Mask), but waiting is canceled if none of the
    //! specified events is signaled within the specified duration or
    //! shortly after that, depending on when this thread is scheduled
    //! again by the operating system scheduler.
    //!
    //! \param[in] duration  The approximate time limit for waiting, e.g.
    //!                      \c boost::posix_time::milliseconds(100). Keep
    //!                      in mind this is only a minimum time for waiting.
    //!                      There is no guarantee that this thread will
    //!                      wake up after exactly the time specified. The
    //!                      operating system scheduler might choose to wait
    //!                      much longer than this requested waiting duration
    //!                      to activate this thread again, especially if
    //!                      another thread is still active. That being said,
    //!                      the accuracy for the waiting time on Linux seems
    //!                      to be approx. 1-2 milliseconds, whereas on Windows
    //!                      the accuracy is significantly worse and has been
    //!                      observed to be anything between 3 and 40 milliseconds.//!
    //! \param[in] eventMask Bit mask of the events to signal. To wait for more
    //!                      than one event combine the corresponding bits with a
    //!                      logical OR. Value must be non-null.
    //! \return The bit mask of the events that have woken up the thread or
    //!         EventMonitor::timeOutEvent. Multiple events are combined in
    //!         the mask using logical \c OR. See also note at wait(Mask).
