Very often, developers mess up the executable permissions and shebangs of Python files. For example,
sometimes the executable permission was accidentally granted, sometimes it is forgotten.

This is a [Flake8][] plugin that ensures the executable permissions and shebangs of Python files are
correctly set. Specifically, it checks the following errors:

- EXE001: Shebang is present but the file is not executable.
- EXE002: The file is executable but no shebang is present.
- EXE003: Shebang is present but does not contain "python".
- EXE004: There is whitespace before shebang.
- EXE005: There are blank or comment lines before shebang.

## Installation

Run:

    pip install flake8-executable

## Usage

Normally, after flake8-executable is installed, invoking flake8 will also run this plugin. For more
details, check out the [Flake8 plugin page][].
