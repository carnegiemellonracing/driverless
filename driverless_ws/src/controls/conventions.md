## Conventions

Conventions for the controls subteam code.

### Naming

Use ``boost``/``STL`` naming.

  - ``lower_snake_case`` for everything except mentioned below
  - ``Upper_snake_case`` for type parameters

### Code Style

  - Follow the cpp core guidelines, except for anything that uses the GSL. Or is otherwise clearly dumb.
