Terminology
===========

General
-------
.. _twist:
**twist**: 6-dimensional velocity, 3 for linear velocity and 3 for angular velocity.

.. _pose:
**pose**: 6-dimensional position, 3 for translation and 3 for orientation.

**spline**: The line through the middle of the track boundaries, generated by |Path Planning|'s SVM algorithm.
Represented as an array of (x,y,z) points. Currently, the car is always fixed to be at point (0,0,0).

**callback** : A function that is called when an event occurs.

**Coordinate frames**:
- *inertial*: Standard coordinate frame, translated and rotated such that the car is at point (0,0,0) with yaw 0 being
the direction the car is facing. Otherwise known as *path planning* frame or erroneously *world* frame.
- *curvilinear*: Coordinate frame in relation to the spline. Coordinates represent distance along spline,
perpendicular distance from spline, angle with tangent of spline, etc. Needed for cost calculation.

----
