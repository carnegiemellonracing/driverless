Terminology
===========

General
-------
.. _twist:
**twist**: 6-dimensional velocity, 3 for linear velocity and 3 for angular velocity.

.. _pose:
**pose**: 6-dimensional position, 3 for translation and 3 for orientation.

**spline**: The line through the middle of the track boundaries, generated by |Path Planning|'s SVM algorithm.
Represented as an array of (x,y,z) points. Currently, the car is always fixed to be at point (0,0,0).

**callback** : A function that is called when an event occurs.

**Coordinate frames**:
- *inertial*: Standard coordinate frame, translated and rotated such that the car is at point (0,0,0) with yaw 0 being
the direction the car is facing. Otherwise known as *path planning* frame or erroneously *world* frame.
- *curvilinear*: Coordinate frame in relation to the spline. Coordinates represent distance along spline,
perpendicular distance from spline, angle with tangent of spline, etc. Needed for cost calculation.

**rollout**: In the context of MPPI, refers to state rollout. A sequence of predicted states calculated by repeated
application of the model on a given starting state and control action trajectory.

CUDA
----
**host**: The CPU

**device**: The GPU

``__device__``: Tag for functions to be run exclusively on the GPU.

``__constant__``: Tag for symbols in device memory that are unmodified by kernels . Can still copy to and from the host.
Read-only in CUDA code. Allows for better caching. Equivalent of ``const``. Constants for both the host and device
should be marked ``__constant__ const``.

ROS

Acronyms
--------
**ROS**: Robot Operating System. We are currently using ROS2 Humble_.
