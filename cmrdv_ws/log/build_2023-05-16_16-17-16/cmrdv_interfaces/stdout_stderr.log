CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:12 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findsbg_driver.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "sbg_driver", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "sbg_driver" with
  any of the following names:

    sbg_driverConfig.cmake
    sbg_driver-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "sbg_driver" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "sbg_driver_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "sbg_driver" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
