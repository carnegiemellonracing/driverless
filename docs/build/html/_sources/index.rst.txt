Overview
===========

This documentation details the electrical systems on Carnegie Mellon Racingâ€™s 2025 driverless Formula SAE vehicle, 24a. Our implementation of 24a was specifically designed to retrofit on an existing FSAE platform and its underlying electrical systems, not a ground-up integration. 

Note on Terminology: Throughout this document, we primarily use "Driverless System" (DS) and related acronyms (e.g., DSMS, DSB, DSSI) as per the latest FSAE Driverless Supplement. Teams should be aware that Formula Student Germany (FSG) rules and earlier versions of FSAE rules may use "Autonomous System" (AS) and corresponding acronyms (e.g., ASMS, ASB, ASSI) to refer to the same concepts.
